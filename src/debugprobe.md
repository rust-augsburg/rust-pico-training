# Picoprobe setup

Two Raspberry Pi Picos are used. PicoA operates as a debug probe, while PicoB serves as the production probe (the target hosting your code).

## Flash debug probe (PicoA)

Download the firmware **`debugprobe_on_pico.uf2`** from:
https://github.com/raspberrypi/debugprobe/releases
ATTENTION: **debugprobe_on_pico.uf2** is needed !!

(Alternatively build the debugprobe from source code as described in [Getting started with Pico](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf) Build and flash picoprobe)

Boot the Raspberry Pi PicoAwith the BOOTSEL button pressed and copy the firmware, e.g.

```sh
sudo cp ~/Downloads/debugprobe_on_pico.uf2 /media/michael/RPI-RP2
```

## Picoprobe Wiring

### Debug Wiring (SWD and UART bridge)

| PicoA |              |  PicoB |              |
|------:|--------------|-------:|--------------|
|   Pin | Description  |    Pin | Description  |
|    38 | GND          | Debug2 | GND          |
|     4 | GP2          | Debug1 | SWCLK        |
|     5 | GP3          | Debug3 | SWDIO        |
|     6 | GP4/UART1 TX |      2 | GP1/UART0 RX |
|     7 | GP5/UART1 RX |      1 | GP1/UART0 TX |

**Note**: DebugPins are numbered from left to right when the USB connector is facing up.

### Power Supply (Optional)

One advantage of using a Pico as a debug probe is that no separate power supply for the PicoB is needed:

| PicoA |             | PicoB |             |
|------:|-------------|------:|-------------|
|   Pin | Description |   Pin | Description |
|    39 | VSYS        |    39 | VSYS        |

Of course It's also possible to provide the power the PicoB via USB.

## Testing Picoprobe

Test with flashing a simple application.
